# BackgroundFox embedder

This repository provides a background player page which embeds YouTube videos based on an ID passed to it.

The purpose is to enable the [BackgroundFox Firefox extension](https://github.com/webful-ltd/backgroundfox-extension) to load videos via this page, which enables background play on Android where it would normally break. You can then keep music playing while using other tabs or apps.
