# BackgroundFox embedder

This repository provides a background player page which embeds YouTube videos based on an ID passed to it.

The purpose is to enable the BackgroundFox Firefox extension to load videos through this, which enables background play on Android where it would normally break. You can then play music while using other tabs or apps.
